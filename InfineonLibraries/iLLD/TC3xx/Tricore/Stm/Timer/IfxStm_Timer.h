 *
 * The timer driver enabled the generation of periodical interrupt based on the STM module.
 *
 *    The driver is initialized with \ref IfxStm_Timer_init(). After initialization, the
 *    timer is started with \ref IfxStm_Timer_run() and stopped with \ref IfxStm_Timer_stop().
 *    Single shot can be set with \ref IfxStm_Timer_setSingleMode(), in case the timer is
 *    already running it will stop after the next event, else the timer event will occur only once.
 *
 *    The timer interrupt must call the \ref IfxStm_Timer_acknowledgeTimerIrq() function which
 *    clears the interrupt flag and set the next compare value.
 *
 *    Changing the period with \ref IfxStm_Timer_setPeriod() or \ref IfxStm_Timer_setFrequency() will
 *    take effect only after the next timer event.
 *
 *
 *    This driver implements a subset of the functionalities defined by \ref library_srvsw_stdif_timer.
 *    If does supports the timer with interrupt but not the trigger signal.
 *
 *    The user is free to use either the driver specific APIs below or to used the \ref library_srvsw_stdif_timer "standard interface APIs".
 *
 *  \section Specific Specific implementation
 *   For a detailed configuration of the microcontroller, see \ref IfxStm_Timer_init().
 *
 *  \section Example Usage example
 *    Initialization and interrupt:
 *  \code
 *  #define ISR_PRIORITY_TIMER_1MS (2)
 *  #define ISR_PROVIDER_TIMER_1MS IfxSrc_Tos_cpu0
 *  #define INTERRUPT_TIMER_1MS    ISR_ASSIGN(ISR_PRIORITY_TIMER_1MS, ISR_PROVIDER_TIMER_1MS)
 *
 *  IfxStm_Timer myTimer;
 *
 *  boolean AppInit_1ms(void)
 *  {
 *      boolean                  result = TRUE;
 *      IfxStm_Timer_Config timerConfig;
 *      IfxStm_Timer_initConfig(&timerConfig, &MODULE_STM0);
 *      timerConfig.base.frequency       = 1000;
 *      timerConfig.base.isrPriority     = ISR_PRIORITY(INTERRUPT_TIMER_1MS);
 *      timerConfig.base.isrProvider     = ISR_PROVIDER(INTERRUPT_TIMER_1MS);
 *      timerConfig.base.minResolution   = (1.0f / timerConfig.base.frequency) / 1000;
 *      timerConfig.comparator           = IfxStm_Comparator_0;
 *      result                           = IfxStm_Timer_init(&myTimer, &timerConfig);
 *
 *      return result;
 *  }
 *
 *  IFX_INTERRUPT(ISR_TIMER_1ms, 0, ISR_PRIORITY_TIMER_1MS)
 *  {
 *      __enable();
 *      IfxStm_Timer_acknowledgeTimerIrq(&myTimer);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *    During run-time, the timer can be started / stopped as follow:
 *  \code
 *      IfxStm_Timer_run(&myTimer);
 *      IfxStm_Timer_stop(&myTimer);
 *  \endcode
